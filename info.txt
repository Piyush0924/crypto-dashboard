This detailed sequence diagram provides a step-by-step overview of the interactions:

The user selects an option from the dropdown component.
The dropdown component dispatches an action indicating the selected option.
The action is received by the Redux store.
The Redux store processes the action:
The action is first handled by the coinApiSlice.
coinApiSlice triggers data fetching from an external API.
Upon successful data retrieval, coinApiSlice updates the store's state with the fetched data.
Then, the action is handled by the dropdownSlice.
dropdownSlice updates the store's state with the selected option.
The Redux store updates its state based on the processed action.
The updated state triggers UI updates in components subscribed to relevant parts of the store's state.
The UI components re-render to display the updated data and selected options to the user.
This detailed diagram provides a comprehensive view of how user interactions trigger actions, which in turn are processed by reducers to update the Redux store's state, leading to UI updates.
